              <p>As stated above, everything so far has been excellent. Provided I maintain the plan, it follows that there may very well be a claim one day. At that time, we will discover exactyl how good the policy is. However, I have no reason to believe it will be other than 'As sold' which is why we decided to proceed with the purchase. It may not be possible as this is 'Health' insurance policy and not a 'Life' insurance policy, but I might suggest that the inclusion of an Optional 'Death Benefit' would have been a very good selling point. Of course, this would require an additional premium but being 'Optional' the purchaser would have ther choice to include it or not.</p>
