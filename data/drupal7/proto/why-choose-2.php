                            <h2>Why do I need expatriate health insurance?</h2>
            <p>The quality of healthcare can vary widely around the world. The quality of care in your new country may not be to the standard you were used to back home. Also, as a foreign national, you and your family will not likely be entitled to any free or subsided healthcare. It is therefore important to consider an expatriate health plan to provide for the healthcare needs of you and your family.</p>
